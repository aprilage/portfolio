      <h1 id="trying-to-establish-git-flow">Trying to Establish Git Flow</h1>
<p>Initially I was going to hop on the MacBook and just start to play around with HTML and CSS for GitHub Pages. I imagined it would be similar to messing around with code for blogger/blogspot back in the day: googling for hex color codes and changing colors, expanding margins, etc. Essentially just playing around and re-familiarizing
myself with basic html and css. However, I then remembered GitHub needs to be part of all this.</p>

<p>So first I was like, “Okay, whatever. I’ll start playing around with the html/css and I’ll just change one thing at a time and make small commits.” Cool….. until I realized I don’t want the changes I make playing around with the code to go live right away. So, okay, how do I fix that? I vaguely remember something about “forking.”  Googled forking with GitHub and used there example/practice repository to learn to clone and download the repository locally.</p>

<p>OKAY, NOW AM I READY TO START PLAYING AROUND WITH CODE? No, because I started messing around and changing things and then I remembered, again, GitHub needs to be part of all this. So I opened GitHub desktop and tried to make the commits there, but I needed help, so I looked through the GitHub desktop guides and guess what? The guide (or at least the one I was using) isn’t written to help you use the GitHub Desktop App. It’s written to help you do everything through command line.</p>

<p>So I opened Terminal and just started there. But finding what you need in all of that output in command line takes some getting used to and I’m still very uneasy about it all. That being said, I would follow the prompts for Terminal and then I kept going back to the GitHub Desktop App like, okay now what do I need to to here? not realizing that I’d already done all of the things in terminal. So I closed GitHub Desktop to get rid of the confusion, Googled then watched + read more tutorials on Git Workflow (something I’d heard and vaguely remembered from talking with either Jason or my brother or my other brother).</p>

<p>Now I’m here, writing about all of this. This process started at at around 7:30AM. It is now 10:36AM and I have made one real commit. Just one. And it wasn’t even to my own code. I’m still playing with the practice repository. But I’ll be honest, I feel good about it. Not “good” like “I started baking this cake and I followed the well defined steps and it came out absolutely perfect.” Nah. This is a different kind of good. This is good like, “damn you didn’t know anything about baking or cakes or the ingredients, but now you know, you have some of the pieces, and next time you’ll be even better.”</p>

<p>I feel like there was no way to avoid having to go through all of this. Even if I’d waited for someone to show me the workflow (which, I’ll be honest, someone already has. More than once.), I would’ve gotten lost down some hole anyway because it’s confusing starting out! At least I was able to pull myself out… I mean kind of. My flow still feels messy and I don’t know if I’m doing everything right, but I’m going to leave it here for a little while. I’m going to go eat lunch and take Han to the park then come back and see how I do once it’s settled in my brain.</p>
