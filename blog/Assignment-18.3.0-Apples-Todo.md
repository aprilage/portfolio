# Assignment 18.3.0 - Apple’s Todo
This assignment introduces me to the work flow of typical companies. When [I researched potential internship positions](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Learning-to-Code--AHB7r7HmlfR5vxz0SD5pEPKOAQ-GOXpabZxZIDuxbXPsP8xR), one of the skill requirements was experience with Agile methodologies, which, being new to all of it at the time, thought was another language or I don’t know, just another scary thing to learn. Turns out it’s the work flow of typical companies. 

One of the things that scares me about this industry is that theres just so much. Like, there are so many files that just go into one app or one webpage and there  are so many different devs working on all those files and how does it all stay together and in order? And webpages and apps do SO MANY things. How do you keep it all together? With other webpages and apps, of course, designed specifically for keeping your webpages and apps that you’re building in order. 

I am using trello. It’s clean, simple to figure out, pretty, and free. I think it’s for those reasons that I really enjoyed this part where you break everything down: what happens when you first open the app, what do you see; what happens when you click here; etc. That alone made the task of building the whole thing seem less daunting. Kind of like Dory in finding Dory: “Ok this way there’s some kelp, this way there’s nothing but empty ocean. I like kelp. *swims toward kelp*. Oh, there’s some shells. I like shells. *swims toward shells*.”

That’s where I ended today. Took me almost two hours to learn how to:

- learn how to use trello
- develop a flow
- make the flow efficient by adding details and photos
- change the flow a little
- use the app and analyze everything that’s happening and turn those things into user stories
- write out the user stories into cards and will correspond with GitHub commits once I start building

One thing at a time and the things organized AF.  

Oh and here’s [a link to my Trello board](https://trello.com/b/8XJSqZqe).
