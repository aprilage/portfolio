*Start: 5/14/18 7:00pm*
The [assignment](http://helpmewithcode.com/topics/translatingDesign/huluHomepage) is to build Hulu‚Äôs home page in HTML and CSS. It‚Äôs hard to even get started because it seems so daunting. I think I‚Äôm afraid of the code. I‚Äôm not joking. And I‚Äôm not even afraid of the real code: I went to atom and typed in html and pressed the tab key to get all of the necessary ‚Äústarting html‚Äù and just seeing it all there was scary. I can‚Äôt think of a better word to describe the feeling: I all of a sudden go into this mindset that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and I shouldn‚Äôt be doing this and I probably can‚Äôt do this. That to me describes fear aka being scared.

And then to open the [screenshot of the Hulu page](http://helpmewithcode.com/topics/translatingDesign/huluHomepage), look back at the blank (except for the beginning html) page in atom ‚Äîrealizing I‚Äôm supposed to *make* this, just pushes me further into a hole.  

I‚Äôll slowly climb out of this hole by focusing on one thing. Just one box. Because they‚Äôre all just boxes, and although they‚Äôre different sizes they‚Äôre basically (1) rectangular pictures with a (2) title, (3) enticing, one-word description, and a (4) logo.

##  (2) title, (3) description, (4) network logo
  Went to the [MDN HTML elements reference page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to familiarize myself with some common elements and decide which one would best fit this portion of the project. Couldn‚Äôt find what I was looking for because I was expecting to find some element that was super specific, but of course, no.

  So I‚Äôll go with a list (as was the case in the [lecture example](https://github.com/helpmewithcode/assignments/blob/master/examples/youtube.html)) because on the homepage it‚Äôs just a list of shows but it‚Äôs more interesting because they added photos and moved the photos around in some kind of grid, but I‚Äôll just focus on the list structure for now. I will copy and paste from the lecture example to get started and change a few things as I go. Starting with the Live TV tile.


  I‚Äôll copy and paste the list item five times and use it as a template.

  Here‚Äôs how the site looks after copy/pasting the list items and adding the content. Not much yet, but I‚Äôm definitely feeling out of that hole I was in earlier. At least, kind of. Still a long way to go. Seems like getting started was the hard part.

















## (1) picture boxes

Not sure how I‚Äôm going to do this but I know I‚Äôm going to look up ‚Äúflexbox‚Äù and ‚Äúgrid‚Äù because they are mentioned during lecture. [After reading about the two](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Relationship_of_Grid_Layout) I decided to go with grid (but not before doing [a bit more research about it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)) because it feels easier to use for what I‚Äôm trying to accomplish. I used code pen to play around with the code and ended up building [the exact layout I need](https://codepen.io/aprilvanderslice/full/VxBdvb) for the project. I felt successful and it was getting late so I used that as a stopping point and went to bed.
*Stop: 5/14 8:00pm*

*Start: 5/15 6:15am*
I woke up this morning excited to work again so I injected the codepen code into my code and it didn‚Äôt work üòñ . The example has each box contained in a div and mine are contained in an unordered list (<ul>. I figure to get it to work I need to make it look more like the example, so I deleted all of the <ul> and <li> elements and separated each thumbnail structure in a div. It worked.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm building a house and I laid down the foundation and built all the walls, so now all I have to do is put the furniture in ‚Äîwhich is usually fun for me so we‚Äôll see if that holds true here.  But first, coffee.
*Stop: 5/15 6:52AM*

*Start: 5/16 1:16PM*
I did work more on it more yesterday during/after coffee but I got so into it I didn‚Äôt do very well keeping a log. Here‚Äôs the basic breakdown of events that lead to this next version of the project:

  - added photos (I didn‚Äôt work hard to find exact photos to match Hulu‚Äôs page)
  - changed the font size and color
  - moved the font within the container
  - didn‚Äôt get to add actual logos though

Honestly, I would like to continue working on this. I didn‚Äôt actually measure space between lines and I don‚Äôt get to practice putting in a logo. Also, I feel that it could look better if the photos were more complimentary to the white text .

Anyway, a very rough draft that I‚Äôm actually pretty proud of considering where my head was at at the beginning of this post.
