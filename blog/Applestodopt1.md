# Apple's Todo Part 1

I am now going to start building the actual app but it seems like I'm missing a lot of steps between what's in my Trello board and opening up a blank page in Atom. Maybe because I'm just starting out and the sight of a blank page still scares me. Grateful for the "html + tab" shortcut in Atom so there's something on the page and a little less scary. Then it's kind of like I'm filling in a form? Idk. A little I guess.

It's hard to remember that building the foundation of a page is going to look rough. Like, I let myself get overwhelmed with how it all looks/acts and feeling like I need to get all of that down right off the bat. Obviously not the case. Let's just start with the title.


Ok. But now what. I'm supposed to be able to click on the title and change it. That's the current Trello card I'm working on. But that doesn't *feel* like the next step. Should I start doing all of that with JavaScript? Or should I continue building the rest of the foundation, move to CSS, *then* start working on changing the title, etc? Here's what I'll do: I'm gonna take the path of least resistance because that feels right right now. So I'll work on how to add in the plus icon.

Brb. Going to google.

This feels too easy. Used Font Awesome Form Icons. Found a + sign.


There's a little more padding in Apple's + icon so I'll work on that when I'm styling. The rest of it seems like it will be JS and CSS. I can't add list items in html because they aren't going to stay there.

...A woman at Starbucks (I'm working from Starbucks) started talking to me about how great my posture is and then we started talking about everything under the sun. Now I have to go home so my husband can take a meeting. Maybe my son will be tired and I'll get to work on some more later.
