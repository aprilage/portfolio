# Assignment 3: Local Jekyll
[Ran into trouble installing RVM](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Trouble-Downloading-RVM-7Ym6GpQSRBQ5wCVajJLrJ?_tk=share_copylink), but with lots of help from my brother I was able to figure it all out. That seems like the easy part now. 

Followed [the instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) exactly for setting up GitHub Pages locally, which may not have been the right thing to do because at some point the instructions help you generate local jekyll files, and I already have them. So now I think what’s happening, is that there’s a disconnect, but I don’t know where the disconnect is. So the first step is to find that. Here’s what my site looks like when I run aprilva$ bundle exec jekyll serve

…….Oh shit. It looks the way it’s supposed to. Oh my gosh. I don’t know where to go from here because I wasn’t expecting that. Ok. Let’s regroup. 

First, I know it’s not much. It’s hard trying to make it into something when I don’t have a plan for what I’m making. Second, I can’t focus on that yet because I’ve done something and now my main text isn’t showing up on the right. So I will try to fix that first.
