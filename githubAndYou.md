# Diving into Github

## React GitHub Repository: Initial Thoughts
- searched google for “react GitHub repository” without even knowing exactly what I was looking for
- The first link was “GitHub- facebook/react” but that’s not where I went. I first clicked on the second link “React Community - GitHub” -I think because my initial reaction whenever searching for anything is to avoid the facebook links because I don’t want to see a company’s facebook page. I want their actual website. However, I remember learning that react is related to facebook in some way so I went back to my search and clicked on the first link. 
- Clicked on the [very first item](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) on the list and I didn’t think I was looking at code. It looks so clean: not a lot of words on one line, not a lot of symbols, mostly words. All separated on different lines like a list.  Looks easy to understand. 
- Clicked [down a few items](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/.gitignore). Had no idea what I was looking at. Just a list of words with * next to them. Noticed the word “node” which we talked about earlier, but I don’t know enough about it to make any sense here. 
- Looked through the “branch” dropdown. Couldn’t find anything that really made any sense. 
- Understood what I was looking at when I clicked on Issues and Pull Requests.
  - Issues: bugs people have noticed or unexpected reactions when a user interacts with the page
  - pull requests: changes or new additions to the project that need to be done
- clicked on one the [items called package.json](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/package.json). Couldn’t figure out any of it.


## Thoughts on contributors to React GitHub Repository 
- Went back to that [first item on the list](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) and clicked on one of the contributors. Looks like he co-created something called Redux. One of his repositories has 95k likes! 
- Clicked on a profile from [one of the few women](https://github.com/sophiebits) on the list of contributors. Happy to see her. According to her green squares, it doesn’t look like she’s contributing as much but it also says she's an “eng manager” so maybe she just doesn’t write much and she’s doing other things.


## Setting up a  GitHub profile (I already have one)
- my profile pales in comparison to the others I looked at. Obviously, I’m not working at facebook or some other big tech company so that makes sense.
- Had trouble adding a bio. My first instinct is to try to write something short/cute/funny like a tweet would be but it doesn’t feel right doing that. I opted for something short, not really cute or funny, but definitely true. Felt good to @barre3 and it show up. 
- Added barre3 to my Organizations. I feel like most people add organizations where they are contributing code, so not sure if that’s okay.
- Definitely want to update my profile photo!
